# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As members, contributors, and leaders, we commit to fostering a harassment-free environment for all community participants. Regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we pledge to uphold the highest standards of respect and inclusivity.

We commit to engaging in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Standards of Conduct

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive community environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Offering and graciously accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility, apologizing, and learning from mistakes
- Prioritizing what is best for the overall community, not just individual interests

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are entrusted with the responsibility to clarify and enforce our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and extends to situations where an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representation include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
